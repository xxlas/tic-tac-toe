## About

**Tic tac toe** basic project with symfony!

Currently, featuring: playing against other human player, basic AI with random moves, basic AI
with a few calculated moves.

## To Do

Remove css/js from files directly and move to assets, need some more research how to properly do that.

More smart moves for the smart AI as currently it's _very_ basic. 

Do some more research on more efficient unit tests.

## Requirements

Everything was done and tested on **macOS** version 11.2.3, **symfony** 5.2 and **php** 7.2.5

## Getting started

How to start: First you will need composer, yarn and symfony installed on your computer.

After installing those, clone/pull project from git to your local environment.

Run `composer install` to install php dependencies.

Run `yarn install` to install yarn dependencies.

Run `yarn encore dev` to compile frontend pages into the public folder.

Run `symfony server:start` to start the localhost virtual server.

After all these steps `symfony server:start` command should've given a localhost link to go to. (default is `127.0.0.1:8000`).
